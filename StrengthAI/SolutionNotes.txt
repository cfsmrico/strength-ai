Progressive Overload AI
	Outcomes:
		increase load and/or volume
		no change
		decrease load and/or volume

	Assumptions:
		adults typically get fatter over time, so bulking in general isn't a great (initial strategy)

	Initial assumption formulas:
	Maintenance to gain muscle: ~15cals/lb BW
	Moderate cut: ~17cals/lb BW

	3000 calories (for me) is a good starting point


Advanced Lifters:
	maximize the number of high quality lifts I can get in with ~85-95% of 1rm
	be conservative with accessory work
